            Here is the complete solution for managing and tracking your crops at single place. Crop management is a crucial aspect 
            of agriculture that involves planning, implementing, and monitoring various practices to ensure optimal crop growth and 
            yield. Effective crop management not only maximizes productivity but also minimizes resource wastage and environmental 
            impact.
            <br><br>
            Crop management is the set of agricultural practices performed to improve the growth, development and yield of crops. 
            It begins with a seedbed preparation, sowing of seeds and crop maintenance; and ends with crop harvest, storage and
            marketing. The timing and sequence of agricultural practices depend upon several factors, such as winter or spring
            crops; harvested products such as grain, hay and silage; sowing methods-broadcast and row-crops; and, plants age, 
            soil, climate and weather conditions.
            <br><br>

            <h2>1-)&nbsp;Seedbeed Preparation</h2>
            <br>
            <p>Seedbed preparation is the first step to improve crop growth and development. The ideal seedbed is uniformly firm, has adequate soil moisture near the surface, and is free from competing weeds. "Good seed-to-soil contact required" is a phrase commonly seen on seeding documents. Seed germination is improved if seeds have good contact with soil. However, too firm a seedbed makes it challenging to get the seed into the ground.</p>
            <br><p>The two primary methods of seedbed preparation are conventional tillage and reduced or no-tillage. The traditional conventional tillage involves turning over the entire plow depth and exposing large quantities of soil organic matter to oxidation. However, reduced or no-tillage practices can lead to an accumulation of soil carbon, which can ultimately benefit soil health and improve crop yields in the long run.</p>

            <br>

            <h2>2-)&nbsp;Planting</h2>
            <br>
            <p>After the seedbed has been prepared, seed should be sowed 1.5 to 2.0 inches deep to ensure proper moisture availability for good seed germination. The seed requires optimum moisture and temperature conditions to germinate, so always pay close attention to soil temperature and moisture requirements for proper seed germination.</p>
            <br>
            <p></p>
            <br><hr>
            <br>

            <h2>3-)&nbsp;Fertilization</h2>
            <br>
            <p>Fertilization may be an important component of crop management. Soils should be tested for available plant nutrients before adding fertilizers to any crop. The addition of appropriate fertilizers determined from the soil and/or plant analysis can ensure the planted crop's nutritional requirement.</p>
            <br>
            <p>The amount of fertilizer, type (bulk-blended or mixed), forms (gas, dry solids or liquid), timing, and method of application (broadcast, deep placement, dribble, foliar, starter, post-emergent, row, strip and variable rate), are all determined by a variety of factors, such as crop and fertilizer type, soil and weather conditions. The previous crop (legume) and past manure applications also influence crop nutrient needs. So, past manure applications should always be accounted for in determining crop needs.</p>
            <br><hr>
            <br>


            <h2>4-)&nbsp;Pest Management</h2>
            <br>
            <p>Pest management is another important aspect of crop management. Pesticides can be powerful tools for controlling pests in most crops, mainly if used correctly based upon specific pest species. Additionally, integrated pest management (IPM) practices can provide growers with an economical option that is safer and often more beneficial to human and natural resources. This IPM approach incorporates mechanical, biological and chemical (labeled pesticides) pest control methods.</p>

            <br>


            <h2>5-)&nbsp;Irrigation</h2>
            <br>
            <p>Irrigation is another critical factor for crop production that influences the final crop yields and quality, especially in our dryland region. Over-irrigation results in leaching of nutrients to the groundwater and/or wasting water and soil erosion via surface runoff. These losses will reduce the efficiency of fertilizers, especially nitrogen.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Before you plant any crop, obtain information regarding water needs and the critical growth stages of that crop, and then determine the irrigation system efficiency to schedule irrigation. If feasible, use irrigation systems that give improved water use efficiencies, such as micro-sprinklers, low-elevation sprinklers and drip (85-95% efficient), or low- and high-pressure center pivots (75-90% efficient). In general, the flood irrigation system is less efficient (20-50%) than other methods. Additionally, if possible, schedule your irrigation during the early morning or late evening to avoid water losses via evaporation.</p>
            <br><hr>
            <br>

            <h2>6-)&nbsp;Harvesting</h2>
            <br>
            <p>Finally, the yield and quality of crops depend upon the harvest management strategy. Too wet or snowy conditions can delay the harvest of the crop. High moisture content delays the mechanical harvesting (windrowing or swathing, direct combining) of the crop/seed. Most of the grain/seed crops should be harvested when they have reached the harvest maturity stage. This timing reduces the yield loss via shattering and lodging. Therefore, missing the right time to harvest often results in severe yield loss.</p>
            <br>
            <p></p>
            <br><hr>
            <br>

            <h2>7-)&nbsp;Post-Harvest Storage</h2>
            <br>
            <p>The post-harvest storage conditions also influence the cropâ€™s forage and grain quality. The harvested crop should be stored at the proper recommended moisture content for each crop to maximize the quality, reduce pest infestation, and avoid deterioration during storage. For example, cereals stored at 14.5 percent moisture content are highly susceptible to quality loss, mold growth and insect infestation. Alfalfa forage should be baled when the moisture content is 18-20% for better quality. </p>
