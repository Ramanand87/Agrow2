# Agrow
This project aims to help farmers in making their work easy and more productive using modern technologies. It includes multiple features at single platform which makes it easy to access and not to roam on different servers.


We provide various features like collection of government agriculture schemes and loan schemes, market place, crop manager which checks crop health using AI agent, ML model for recognition of soil type, providing weather information for 5 days, suggesting different farming techniques, etc.
And Agrow is language independent and uses speech recognition also.
